# websocket-refresh-chrome-ext
A chrome extension that will refresh tabs based on messages sent from a websocket server

I found myself needing somethign like this for a project I'm working on where I cannot use any of the available servers like webpackdevserver or express because I needed to refresh a tab on a content management system.

> this extension is based on a starter from the good folks at: https://extensionizr.com
